            <h2>The Pig Game</h2>
            <p>The Pig game is simple to learn as the rules are simple to explain.</p> 
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    First the game is for two players.  Each player rolls a single die as many times as he/she wishes.  The result of each roll is added to his/her ROUND score.</li>
                <li>
                    If the player rolls a 1 he loses  ROUND score and the turn passes to the next player</li>
                <li>
                    Additionally, if a player rolls a double six, he/she loses both his round and Global score.</li>
                <li>
                    The player can choose to 'Hold', which means that his ROUND score gets added to his "Global" score. After that, it's the next player's turn</li>
                <li>
                    The first player to reach 100 points in their "Global" score wins the game.</li>
            </ul>
